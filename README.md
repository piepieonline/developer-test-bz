# Berlitz React Developer Test - Thomas Roberts

## Instructions to build

* Using npm version 10.15.1 (LTS):
* `npm install`
* `npm start` - It should open a browser tab automatically, otherwise it will be at http://localhost:3000/#

## Assumptions

* I have made an assumption regarding how the mobile version should work, and attached a rough mockup to my email.
* I have made an assumption regarding the design of the "Item added to cart!" message.

## Notes

* I noticed the en-US spelling of 'Colors', and have left it as such. This is something I would ideally clarify (or know the target audience for the page).
* The provided assets had more whitespace than the mockup counterparts, and so I have trimmed them to remove most of this whitespace.
* The font I have used only has two weight levels, which doesn't precisely match the design provided.
